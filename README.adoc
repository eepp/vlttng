**_vlttng_** is a tool which creates a virtual environment (a sandbox)
to run specific versions of the http://lttng.org/[LTTng] packages.

The https://babeltrace.org/[Babeltrace]{nbsp}1 and{nbsp}2,
https://liburcu.org/[Userspace RCU],
https://github.com/lttng/lttng-analyses[LTTng analyses],
https://github.com/lttng/lttng-scope[LTTng Scope], and
http://tracecompass.org/[Trace Compass] projects are also supported, as
well as some of the project dependencies.

== Install vlttng

To install vlttng on the system:

* Use `pip3`:
+
--
----
$ sudo pip3 install --upgrade vlttng
----
--

To install vlttng in your home directory:

* Use `pip3`:
+
--
----
$ pip3 install --user --upgrade vlttng
----
--
+
The commands are installed in `~/.local/bin`.

Two new commands are available: `vlttng` and `vlttng-quick`.

== Quickstart

The easiest way to get started with vlttng is to use its `vlttng-quick`
command. This command interactively asks you a few questions to create a
basic `vlttng` command line that you can use later or immediately.

== How does vlttng work?

The `vlttng` command does the following:

. Reads one or more _profiles_ that you give on the command line to know
  which packages to fetch and build.

. Fetches and extracts the requested packages.
+
vlttng supports Git with a specific branch/tag/commit as well as
HTTP/FTP tarball sources. The Git clone URL can point to a local Git
repository using the `file://` protocol.

. Builds one package at a time, setting some environment variables and
  configure options so that the dependencies of the packages are
  contained within the virtual environment.

. Creates an `activate` script which you can _source_ from your
  Bash/Zsh prompt to "`enter`" the virtual environment.
+
This script sets a few environment variables, like `PATH`,
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and `PYTHONPATH`, to achieve this. By default, it
also prepends the name of the virtual environment directory to your
shell prompt for you to know which virtual environment is active.
+
When you source the `activate` script, if the LTTng-modules project is
part of the effective profile, `vlttng` removes the currently loaded
LTTng kernel modules and sets the `MODPROBE_OPTIONS` environment
variable so that the LTTng session daemon loads the virtual environment
modules.

Example:

----
$ vlttng -p lttng-stable-2.11 -p babeltrace2-master -p babeltrace2-python \
         -p lttng-tools-no-lttng-relayd -p urcu-stable-0.10 virt
----

Here, we're using five profiles to create a virtual environment in the
`virt` directory. Source the generated `activate` script to enter the
virtual environment:

----
$ . ./virt/activate
----

Your prompt starts with `[virt]` after this (the name of the virtual
environment directory).

"`Exit`" the virtual environment with the `vlttng-deactivate` command.
Your prompt will return to its previous value.

== Write and use profiles

A vlttng profile is a layer of configuration. You can use multiple
profiles to create an _effective profile_.

The project ships with more than 1000 default profiles. Use
`vlttng --list-default-profiles` to list their names.

Profiles are written in YAML. Here's an example:

[source,yaml]
----
build-env:
  CFLAGS: -O0 -g3
virt-env:
  ENABLE_FEATURE: '1'
  SOME_PATH: /path/to/omg
projects:
  lttng-tools:
    source: 'git://git.lttng.org/lttng-tools.git'
    checkout: stable-2.11
    build-env:
      CC: clang
      CFLAGS: ''
  lttng-ust:
    source: 'http://lttng.org/files/lttng-ust/lttng-ust-2.11.0.tar.bz2'
    configure: --enable-python-agent
  lttng-modules:
    source: 'git://git.lttng.org/lttng-modules.git'
    checkout: stable-2.11
  urcu:
    source: 'git://git.liburcu.org/userspace-rcu.git'
----

A few things to note here:

* The root `build-env` property defines the base build environment
  variables. They are set when building the projects. `vlttng` also
  passes exported shell variables to the executed programs, so you can
  do:
+
----
$ CC=clang CFLAGS='-O0 -g3' vlttng ...
----

* The root `virt-env` property defines the virtual environment
  variables, which are set when you activate the virtual environment.
  Exported shell variables when you run `vlttng` are _not_ set when
  you activate the resulting virtual environment.
* The available project names, as of this version, are:
** `babeltrace2`
** `babeltrace`
** `elfutils`
** `glib`
** `libxml2`
** `lttng-analyses`
** `lttng-modules`
** `lttng-scope`
** `lttng-tools`
** `lttng-ust`
** `popt`
** `tracecompass`
** `urcu`
* The `build-env` property of a specific project defines environment
  variables to be used only during the build stage of this project. A
  project-specific build-time environment variable overrides a base
  build-time environment variable sharing its name.
* When the `source` property contains a Git URL, or when the `checkout`
  property is set, the `checkout` property indicates which branch, tag,
  or commit to check out. When it's not specified, `vlttng` checks out
  the `master` branch.
* The `configure` property specifies the options to pass to the
  `configure` script of a given project. `vlttng` takes care of some
  options itself, like `--prefix` and `--without-lttng-ust`, to create a
  working virtual environment.

You can save the profile above to a file, for example `my-profile.yml`,
and then you can create a virtual environment out of it:

----
$ vlttng -p my-profile.yml virt
----

When you give multiple profiles to `vlttng`, the first profile is
"`patched`" with the second, which is then patched with the third, and
so on, as such:

* Nonexistent properties are created.
* Existing properties are replaced recursively.
* The `configure` properties are _joined_.

For example, let's add the following profile (call it `more.yaml`) to
the example above:

[source,yaml]
----
build-env:
  CFLAGS: -O0
  SOMEVAR: ok
projects:
  lttng-tools:
    source: 'https://github.com/lttng/lttng-tools.git'
  lttng-ust:
    configure: --enable-java-agent-jul
----

With this command:

----
$ vlttng -p my-profile.yml -p more.yaml virt
----

the effective profile is:

[source,yaml]
----
build-env:
  CFLAGS: -O0
  SOMEVAR: ok
projects:
  lttng-tools:
    source: 'https://github.com/lttng/lttng-tools.git'
    checkout: stable-2.11
    build-env:
      CC: clang
      CFLAGS: ''
  lttng-ust:
    source: 'http://lttng.org/files/lttng-ust/lttng-ust-2.11.0.tar.bz2'
    configure: --enable-python-agent --enable-java-agent-jul
  lttng-modules:
    source: 'git://git.lttng.org/lttng-modules.git'
    checkout: stable-2.11
  urcu:
    source: 'git://git.liburcu.org/userspace-rcu.git'
----

[[override]]
== Override a profile property

Replace, append to, and remove effective profile properties (after
`vlttng` has merged all the profiles given with the `--profile` option
as an effective profile) with the `--override` (`-o`) option.

The three override operations are:

Replace a property:: {empty}
+
----
PATH=REPLACEMENT
----

Append to a property:: {empty}
+
----
PATH+=APPEND
----

Remove a property:: {empty}
+
----
!PATH
----

`PATH` is the path to the property, from the root of the profile, using
a dot-separated list of keys to find recursively.

Example:

----
-o projects.lttng-tools.configure+=--disable-bin-lttng-relayd \
-o '!projects.lttng-ust.checkout' \
-o build-env.CC=clang
----

In replace and append modes, `vlttng` creates the property if it does
not exist. This allows you to create projects on the command line:

----
-o projects.lttng-tools.source=https://github.com/lttng/lttng-tools.git \
-o projects.lttng-tools.checkout=v2.11.0 \
-o projects.lttng-tools.configure='--disable-bin-lttng --disable-man-pages'
----

`vlttng` applies the overrides in command line order.

== Ignore a project

Ignore specific projects that exist in the effective profile with the
`--ignore-project` (`-i`) option:

----
$ vlttng -p lttng-stable-2.11 -p urcu-master -i lttng-ust virt
----

This is the equivalent of removing the project's property with an
<<override,override>>:

----
$ vlttng -p lttng-stable-2.11 -p urcu-master -o '!projects.lttng-ust' virt
----

== Make the output verbose

By default, `vlttng` hides the standard output and error of the commands
it runs. In this mode, `vlttng` prints all the commands to run and the
exported environment variables along with comments, so that you can
"`replay`" the entire output as is to create the same virtual
environment (except for the `activate` script which would not be
generated).

You can use the `--verbose` (`-v`) option to also print the standard
output and error of all the executed commands, and the effective profile
used to create the virtual environment.

== Define the number of make jobs

`vlttng` passes its `--jobs` (`-j`) option as is to `make`.

The default value of `--jobs` option is the number of active CPUs on your
system.

== `activate` script options

When you source the `activate` script, use the following environment
variables to alter its behaviour:

`VLTTNG_NO_RMMOD`::
    Set to `1` to disable the unloading of the currently loaded LTTng
    kernel modules.

`VLTTNG_NO_PROMPT`::
    Set to `1` to keep your current shell prompt after the activation.

== Use `sudo`

If you use `sudo` when the virtual environment is activated, make sure
to use its `--preserve-env` (`-E`) option so that the virtual
environment is preserved when it executes the command.

For example, to start a root LTTng session daemon which loads the LTTng
kernel modules installed in the virtual environment:

----
$ sudo --preserve-env lttng-sessiond --daemonize
----

== Trace a Java application

When the LTTng-UST project is built with a Java agent, the activation
of the virtual environment sets the `VLTTNG_CLASSPATH` environment
variable to a Java class path to use when you compile and run
Java applications.

Example:

----
$ javac -cp $VLTTNG_CLASSPATH MyClass.java
$ java -cp $VLTTNG_CLASSPATH:. MyClass
----

== Use the virtual environment's Python packages

If the LTTng-UST Python agent is built and installed in the virtual
environment, there's nothing special to do to trace a Python
application: the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable contains the path to
the LTTng-UST Python agent package in the virtual environment. You can
import the `lttngust` package as usual.

As such, you can import the `babeltrace` and `bt2` Python{nbsp}3
packages directly.

== Update a project with a Git source

`vlttng` generates the following scripts in the virtual environment's
root directory (`_NAME_` is the project name):

`conf-_NAME_.bash`::
    Runs the configuration step of the project.

`build-_NAME_.bash`::
    Runs the build step of the project.

`install-_NAME_.bash`::
    Runs the install step of the project.

`update-_NAME_.bash` (only with a Git source)::
    Fetches the project's configured Git remote, checks out the latest
    version of the configured branch, and runs `conf-_NAME_.bash`,
    `build-_NAME_.bash`, and `install-_NAME_.bash`.

IMPORTANT: Use those scripts with caution. For a stable branch, they
_should_ work most of the time. For the `master` branch, some required
implicit configuration and build command lines might be missing from the
scripts when you use the update script.
